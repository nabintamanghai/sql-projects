# **World Layoffs Analysis**

## **About The Project**
This project focuses on cleaning raw, messy data, performing data normalization & standardization, removing duplicates, filtering data, handling missing values, addressing unwanted spaces, and correcting datatype casting using SQL. 

The dataset used in this project contains inconsistencies, null values, incorrect formatting, and other data quality issues. The goal is to transform the data into a structured and usable format for further analysis.

## **Tools Used**
- **MySQL**

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project includes records of **2,361 layoffs** from various companies worldwide. It covers layoffs across different companies, countries, and industries during the **COVID-19 pandemic**.

## **World Layoffs Analysis**
In today's dynamic economic environment, layoffs have become a significant aspect of corporate decision-making. Organizations across industries often downsize their workforce due to financial constraints, technological advancements, mergers, or economic downturns. This project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing global layoff records to uncover key trends and insights.

## **Project Objectives**
The primary goal of this project is to perform **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on global layoff data. The analysis aims to:

- Examine layoff trends across various industries and regions.
- Identify companies with the highest workforce reductions.
- Assess the economic and business factors influencing layoffs worldwide.
- Determine the state of companies that laid off **100%** of their employees.

By conducting this analysis, we aim to provide valuable insights into global layoff patterns and their broader impact on the workforce.

|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Removing Duplicates**    | - Created a staging table (`layoffs_staging`) to preserve raw data.<br>- Identified and removed duplicates using SQL window functions. |
| **Standardizing Fields**   | - Trimmed whitespace in `company`.<br>- Standardized inconsistent spellings/cases in `industry`.<br>- Corrected country names (e.g., removed trailing periods).<br>- Converted `date` from text to date format. |
| **Handling Missing Values**| - Removed rows with nulls in both `total_laid_off` and `percentage_laid_off`.<br>- Converted blank `industry` entries to nulls and filled them using company records where possible. |
| **Eliminating Columns**    | - Dropped temporary columns (e.g., `row_num`).<br>- Removed records missing critical data to maintain integrity. |
