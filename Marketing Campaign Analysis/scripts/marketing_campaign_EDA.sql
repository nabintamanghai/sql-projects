/*
Description:
Followging project measures how well marketing campaigns did using SQL.
It uses data stored in a table called 'marketing_campaign' which includes fields such as 
campaign id, campaign name, channel, region, cost, impressions, clicks, conversions, revenue, start date & end date.

Goal:
The goal is to analyze key marketing metrics to understand which campaigns, channels, 
or regions performed best. The key metrics are:
- ROI (Return on Investment)
- CTR (Click-Through Rate)
- CPC (Cost Per Click)
- Conversion Rate
- CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)
- CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

By analyzing these metrics overall, by campaign, by channel, by region, and over time (monthly), we can identify:
- Which campaigns are most cost effective
- Which marketing channels are driving the best results
- Seasonal trends in impressions and conversions
- Opportunities to improve targeting and efficiency etc.

How the Queries Work:
- First, data integrity is checked for duplicates.
- Summary metrics such as total spend, revenue, impressions, clicks, and conversions are calculated.
- KPIs like ROI, CTR, CPC, etc are calculated at different group levels: campaign, region, channel, and month.
